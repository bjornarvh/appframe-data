# appframe-data-object
A data object implementation for AppframeWeb. Minimal dependencies, but less features than afDataObject.

While the afDataObject works well, this project is created to mainly to achieve 2 things:

1. To use data sources outside Appframe articles. Be it for local application development, running in a node environment, or sharing data sources between articles.
2. No dependencies, to be able to use data objects without any other scripts included.

While we don't aim to be completely compatible with afDataObject, we will try to stay compatible with the most common features, and most importantly the constructor, so that the data object scripts generated by Appframe can still be used.
